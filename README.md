## Who is this for?
I got the idea for this application because I have quite a few care assistants and each of them has a key. Also my family members have each a key. That's a lot of keys, and I have previously managed the keys manually in a paper ledger. This is quite unwieldy though, so I thought to myself that it would be really nice to have an application where I can do all administration.

Not every person has care assistants, but everybody has keys and many of them have trouble remembering where the keys are or who has them. This application is meant for those people.
