# Key Ledger
I got the idea for this application because I have quite a few care assistants 
and each of them has a key to my home. My family members also have a key each. 
That's a lot of keys, and I have previously managed the keys manually in a 
paper ledger. This is quite unwieldy though, so I thought to myself that it 
would be really nice to have an application where I can do all administration.
